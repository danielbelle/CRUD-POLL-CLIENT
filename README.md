# CRUD POLL CLIENT

I developed an application in NodeJS with the function of GET, DELETE and CREATE. To start the server just type npm start or yarn start.

I used the extensions: @emotion/react, @mui/material, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, axios, bootstrap, dotenv, react, react-bootstrap, react-dom, react-router-dom, react-scripts, web-vitals
